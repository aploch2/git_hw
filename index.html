        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Austin Ploch. I am a perspective web developer studying at Waukesha County Technical College. I first got interested in web design when I took a class during my junior year of high school. It started as just a fun course to take to fill the schedule. Shortly after, I realized I really enjoyed learning HTML and CSS. I would go home after school every day and learn on my own, until I was very far ahead of the class. After the semester ended, I pretty much dropped web design and went back to what I wanted to study in college, graphic design. I didn't do anything with web design until a year and a half later when I applied to the Art Institute of Minneapolis and my advisor suggested I study web design instead of graphic design. I didn't do much to expand my knowledge at that school since it was an art school, so I spent the first year doing drawing and painting. I found myself very unhappy with the program and I moved home and started at WCTC. In the future, I plan on working independently, but I still have a long way to go until I can achieve that. </p>
